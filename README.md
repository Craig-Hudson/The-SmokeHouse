## Introduction

Here we have a fresh responsive website for a local independent restaurant.
The aims for this website are to make it easier for existing and new potential customers to be able to make online reservations and to be able to easily view what the restaurant offers and not only that we want all new potential customers to be able to view stunning images of our fresh modern restaurant, and we want them to be able to view testimonials from previous customers.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories (US)

- **First time visitor goals**
    1. As a first time visitor i want a nice clean site that is easy to navigate.
    2. As a first time visitor i want to be able to easily identify where to find the menu.
    3. As a first time visitor i want to be able to easily find the whereabouts of the restaurant.

  - **Returning Visitor goals**
    1. As a returning Visitor i want to know if their are any current offers/deals on.

### Design

- **Colour Scheme**
  ![color pallette](/assets/readme-images/Color-Hunt-Palette-27374d526d829db2bfdde6ed.png)

  - I will be using white smoke and #526D82 colour text against the background colours.
  - I will be using #27374D and #DDE6ED as background colors

  - **typography**
    - For headings I will be using Black Han Sans with a fallback of sans-serif.
    - For page text I will be using Quattrocento with a fall back of serif.

  - **Structure**
    - The structure will be a single scrolling page, with multiple pages with each section being clearly identifiable, and a separate page for the reservation booking form.

  - **Imagery**
    - I will be using images of food and pictures of the restaurant to create more of a visual effect and to make the site more appealing to viewers.

  - **Wireframes**

### Bugs

#### Solved bugs

|  no   | Bug  | How i Solved the bug
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------- |
|  1 | The bottom alignment of the testimonial section wasn't aligning on smaller devices under 768px  | At the time i had bootstrap classes which worked fine on larger screen sizes. So i went with using flexbox and using the space-around property to give the top and bottom alignment a fixed height, along with flex wrap so that all text is wrapped inside each container.  |
