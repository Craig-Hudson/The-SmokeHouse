## Introduction

Here we have a fresh responsive website for a local independent restaurant.
The aims for this website are to make it easier for existing and new potential customers to be able to make online reservations and to be able to easily view what the restaurant offers and not only that we want all new potential customers to be able to view stunning images of our fresh modern restaurant, and we want them to be able to view testimonials from previous customers.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories (US)

- **First time visitor goals**
    1. As a first time visitor i want a nice clean site that is easy to navigate.
    2. As a first time visitor i want to be able to easily identify where to find the menu.
    3. As a first time visitor i want to be able to easily find the whereabouts of the restaurant.

  - **Returning Visitor goals**
    1. As a returning Visitor i want to be able to easily reserve a table.
    2. As a returning visitor i want to be able to easily find contact information for any queries.

### Design

![color pallette](/assets/readme-images/Color-Hunt-Palette-27374d526d829db2bfdde6ed.png)

- I will be using white smoke and #526D82 colour text against the background colours.
  - I will be using #27374D, #DDE6ED and white as background colors

  - **typography**
  - For headings I will be using Black Han Sans with a fallback of sans-serif.
    - For page text I will be using Quattrocento with a fall back of serif.

  - **Structure**
    - The structure will be a single scrolling page, with multiple pages with each section being clearly identifiable, and the use of a pop up modal for the reservation booking form which has a form dump which opens up in a new tab, to allow the user to be able to stay on the website itself to be able to continue browsing if they would like to. and the use of an image carousel to make the website more appealing and not overloading the website full of images that aren't contained.

  - **Imagery**
    - I will be using images of food and pictures of the restaurant to create more of a visual effect and to make the site more appealing to viewers, all of the images on the website were taken from [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)

  - **Wireframes**

 [View wireframes here](/assets/wireframe-images/)

### Accessability

I have been attentive to make the website as accessible-friendly as possible through the following measures:

- Utilizing semantic HTML to provide meaningful structure and enhance accessibility.
- Incorporating descriptive alt attributes for images on the site to provide alternative text for screen readers.
- I also tested my website using wave which reports back to me any errors/contrast errors that may occur.
  
By implementing them few points above i have made my webpage as accessible and user friendly as possible taking into account those who may be visually impaired and require screen readers for assistance.

## Features

- The Smokehouse webpage is a single page website which contains a navbar, which comprises of a hamburger menu for smaller devices, a pop up modal for reservation booking, an image carousel with a welcome message,a menu section, our story section, testimonial section and a footer.

### Favicon

- A favicon in the browser tab
  
![Favicon Image](/assets/readme-images/favicon-feature.png)

### Image Carousel

- A carousel of images at the top of the page, with a welcome message on the first image
![Image Carousel](/assets/readme-images/image-carousel.png)

### Pop up Modal

- I went with a pop up modal booking form rather than having a booking form on a separate page, this was to keep the structure of the website all contained onto 1 page that is scrollable rather than just having 1 page that splits off from the rest of the website.
![Pop up modal](/assets/readme-images/pop-up-modal.png)

### Menu

- I created a basic menu with starters and mains
![Menu](/assets/readme-images/menu.png)

### Testimonials

- I created a testimonial section to show new customers what they can expect from the company
![Testimonials](/assets/readme-images/testimonials.png)

### Our Story

- I created a heading with an image to open up the our story section
![Our story heading](/assets/readme-images/about-us-heading.png)

- Then i have created a section that gives a brief overview of the history and gives contact, location, and opening times below.

### Bugs

#### Solved bugs

|  no   | Bug  | How i Solved the bug|
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| 1 | On wider screen widths the menu alignment got far to stretched and looked off  | I noticed i had the bootstrap class container-fluid set as the container which gives the container the full width of the screen, so i changed the bootstrap class to container, which will only allow the width on the container to be as wide as the content inside of it  |
| 2 |  On Different screen widths the testimonial sections alignment of the images and the star ratings would not align horizontally  | I had a play around with different flexbox properties and i ended up aligning the container of the testimonial section to align-items: flex-start as they aligned the images and the star ratings  |
|3 |In the menu section when i hit the 992px breakpoint the menu would shrink to 50% width but all still be in one column,it would only turn into 50% width when it hits 993px and turns into two columns side by side| I used chrome developer tools and played around with my code on their until i found the culprit was in the wrong media query so i just swapped the code over into the correct media query, and all seems to be working well since the fix.  |
|4 | In the Our story section where there is contact information, the email address ending up spanning onto two lines when it should only be on one line between screen width of 992px and 1200px| I played around with margins for the row that contained the email address until the email was completely on one line and then entered a min-width / max width media query to solve this issue  |

#### Known Bugs

|  known bugs | Bug issue  | Plan to resolve  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1  | On wider screen widths the menu alignment got far to stretched and looked off  | I plan to ensure that the container is only as wide as it needs to be  |
| 2 | On Different screen widths the testimonial sections alignment of the images and the star ratings would not align horizontally  | I plan to use flexbox to resolve this issue.  |
