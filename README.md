## Introduction

Here we have a fresh responsive website for a local independent restaurant.
The aims for this website are to make it easier for existing and new potential customers to be able to make online reservations and to be able to easily view what the restaurant offers and not only that we want all new potential customers to be able to view stunning images of our fresh modern restaurant, and we want them to be able to view testimonials from previous customers.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories (US)

- **First time visitor goals**
    1. As a first time visitor i want a nice clean site that is easy to navigate.
    2. As a first time visitor i want to be able to easily identify where to find the menu.
    3. As a first time visitor i want to be able to easily find the whereabouts of the restaurant.

  - **Returning Visitor goals**

### Design

- **Colour Scheme**
  ![color pallette](/assets/readme-images/Color-Hunt-Palette-27374d526d829db2bfdde6ed.png)

  - I will be using white smoke and #526D82 colour text against the background colours.
  - I will be using #27374D and #DDE6ED as background colors

  - **typography**
    - For headings I will be using Black Han Sans with a fallback of sans-serif.
    - For page text I will be using Quattrocento with a fall back of serif.

  - **Structure**
    - The structure will be a single scrolling page, with multiple pages with each section being clearly identifiable, and the use of a pop up modal for the reservation booking form.

  - **Imagery**
    - I will be using images of food and pictures of the restaurant to create more of a visual effect and to make the site more appealing to viewers.

  - **Wireframes**

### Bugs

#### Solved bugs

|  no   | Bug  | How i Solved the bug
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| 1 | On wider screen widths the menu alignment got far to stretched and looked off  | I noticed i had the bootstrap class container-fluid set as the container which gives the container the full width of the screen, so i changed the bootstrap class to container, which will only allow the width on the container to be as wide as the content inside of it  |
| 2 |  On Different screen widths the testimonial sections alignment of the images and the star ratings would not align horizontally  | I had a play around with different flexbox properties and i ended up aligning the container of the testimonial section to align-items: flex-start as they aligned the images and the star ratings  |

#### Known Bugs

|  known bugs | Bug issue  | Plan to resolve  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1  | On wider screen widths the menu alignment got far to stretched and looked off  | I plan to ensure that the container is only as wide as it needs to be  |
| 2 | On Different screen widths the testimonial sections alignment of the images and the star ratings would not align horizontally  | I plan to use flexbox to resolve this issue.  |
